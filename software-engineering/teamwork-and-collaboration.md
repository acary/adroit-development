# Teamwork & Collaboration

## Solving problems as a team

Understanding systems, common problems encountered and performing root cause analysis is a large part of programming. While much of the work can be done independently, discussing approaches, comparing tradeoffs and integrating new and legacy systems is very much a team sport.

$ help help

Getting help often requires requesting it specifically. Using the help command is usually a good starting point for local development. Check the Documentation \(or "docs"\) section for whichever language or framework you are working with for more specific information. Seeking additional help online or in communities around and within your organization can uncover further clues or pathways to resolution.
{% endhint %}

Outside of the manual, asking other people can help express your problems succinctly and learn from the experience and perspective of others. Most people are open-minded and welcoming when people ask for their advice or know-how \(or at least they should be\).
